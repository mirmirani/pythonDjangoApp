Python Django App

This was my first Python and Django Application
Here I learned to -\
\
    - set up a virtual environment\
    - set up a custom skeleton django app\
    - use a built-in django server\
    - create a new database model by running migrations\
    - add a url, import views, send a get request\
    - create an index template and link pages\
    - add a route and view to render the template\
    \
